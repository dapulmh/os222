# WEEK-00

1. [Operating system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that controls how computer hardware 
and software resources are used and offers basic services to other software applications.

2. [Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch1.pptx)<br>
This slide is a good introduction for understanding OS. With this slide I learn 
more about the OS and its environment as well as the hardware

3. [What defines an Operating System?](https://rahmatm.samik-ibrahim.vlsm.org/2021/07/what-defines-operating-system.html)<br>
The operating system is a layer of software that comes preinstalled on computers 
and is responsible for giving user programs a better, simpler, cleaner model of 
the computer and for handling all the resources already described.

4. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
By the beginning of the 1950s, computers had become so quick that manually loading 
programs using punch cards was frequently quicker than actually running them. 


# WEEK-01

1. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU)<br>
There are several Linux commands that are recommended for students to understand. 

2. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The most well-known and traditional text editor for Linux is the VI editor. The 
full-screen UNIX vi editor has two modes of operation: Insert mode, which inserts 
entered text into the file, and Command mode, which executes commands that cause 
action to be taken on the file.

3. [Regular Expressions - Linux Tutorial 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpyCeSvGh-M)<br>
Some of the commonly used commands with Regular expressions are tr, sed, vi and grep. 
Listed below are some of the basic Regex.
Symbol	Descriptions
```
.	| replaces any character
^	| matches start of string
$	| matches end of string
*	| matches up zero or more times the preceding character
\	| Represent special characters
()	| Groups regular expressions
?	| Matches up exactly one character
```

# WEEK-02

1. [what is cybersecurity ?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity)<br>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.

2. [Which Information Should You Keep Private ? ](http://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/complete-beginners-guide-to-internet-safety-privacy/)<br>
Metadata
Metadata is the descriptive information about our communications and activities. It allows for government agencies and other organizations to make inferences about you without actually listening to your phone calls or monitoring your computer. Because many of the privacy laws that the NSA and internet companies fall under are outdated, their application to metadata is unclear. This information can be used to determine someone’s location via their devices without directly “tracking” them.

Passwords
Keeping your passwords private is an obvious addition to this list. However, using strong passwords is just as important as keeping your passwords private and secure. If you are using a short and predictable password, it will be vulnerable to brute force attacks. It’s a good idea to use longer and more complex passwords, with a reputable password manager to store them. This way you can use a different password for each service without having to remember them all.

Financial Information
Keeping your financial information safe on the internet can be overwhelming, especially if you are accustomed to doing a lot of online shopping. It is important that you only share this information on secure websites that you trust and that use HTTPS (SSL encryption). Breaches in financial information can lead to identity theft and can damage your credit

3. [6 Benefits of Cyber Security – Defending Against Cyber Attacks](https://deandorton.com/cyber-security-benefits/)<br>

```
1. Protection against external threats
2. Protection against internal threats
3. Regulation compliance
4. Improved productivity
5. Cost savings and value
6. Brand trust and reputation
```

2.[File Systems in Operating System: Structure, Attributes, Types](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)

A file is a collection of correlated information which is recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage like magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes. It is a method of data collection that is used as a medium for giving input and receiving output from that program.

3.[Fragmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/fragmentation-in-operating-system)

Fragmentation is an unwanted problem in the operating system in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented. Processes can't be assigned to memory blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused. It is also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted from memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. These small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, resulting in inefficient memory use.

# WEEK-04

1.[Difference between Virtual and Physical Address](https://www.javatpoint.com/virtual-vs-physical-address)

The addresses identify a location in the memory where the actual code resides in the system in the operating system. We store the data in the memory at different locations with addresses to access the data again whenever required in the future. There are two types of addresses used for memory in the operating system, i.e., the physical address and logical address.

The logical address is a virtual address viewed by the user. The user can't view the physical address directly. The logical address is used as a reference to access the physical address. The fundamental difference between logical and physical addresses is that the CPU generates the logical address during program execution. In contrast, the physical address refers to a location in the memory unit.

2.[Paging, Memory Management, Operating System](gatevidyalay.com/paging-memory-management-operating-system/)

This site has a good explanation about paging and memory management in general.

There's many method to backup VM(s) on virtual box such as :

- Snapshots
- Exporting VMs <br>

2.[Demand Paging in OS (Operating System): Example, Advantages, Working](https://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)

  Demand paging is a process of swapping in the Virtual Memory system. In this process, all data is not moved from hard drive to main memory because while using this demand paging, when some programs are getting demand then data will be transferred. But, if required data is already existed into memory then not need to copy of data. The demand paging system is done with swapping from auxiliary storage to primary memory, so it is known as “Lazy Evaluation”. <br>

3.[How computer memory works - Kanawat Senanan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4)

This video help me to understand how memory works. It visualizes the processes happening inside our computer. <br>

4.[Page Replacement in OS](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operating-system/page-replacement-algorithm/)

Page replacement is needed in the operating systems that use virtual memory using Demand Paging. As we know that in Demand paging, only a set of pages of a process is loaded into the memory. This is done so that we can have more processes in the memory at the same time. <br>

5.[How to Cut, Copy and Paste in Vim / Vi](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/cut-copy-paste-vim)

Vim is a commonly used open-source text editor installed by default on most Unix distributions. You can use the text editor in two modes, from a command-line interface or as an independent application in a GUI. <br>

1.[Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing: What's the Difference?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/multithreading-vs-multiprocessing)

Multithreading is a programming technique that assigns multiple code segments to a single process. These code segments, also referred to as threads, run concurrently and parallel to each other.

Multiprocessing refers to a system that has more than two central processing units (CPUs). Every additional CPU added to a system increases its speed, power and memory. This allows users to run multiple processes simultaneously. Each CPU may also function independently, and some CPUs may remain idle if they don't have anything to process. 

2.[fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)

Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.

3.[What is Process Scheduling?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-scheduling)

The act of determining which process is in the ready state, and should be moved to the running state is known as Process Scheduling.

4.[Understanding fork() system call for new process creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxTbksJ2fo)

This video help me to understanding fork system.

5.[L-1.11: Process Vs Threads in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITc09gOrqZk)

This video help me to understanding process and threads in operating system.

# WEEK-07

1. [Introduction of Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/?ref=lbp)

Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 
Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. A similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s).

2. [How to Use SCP Command to Securely Transfer Files](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/)

it's help me to finish my weekly assignment

3. [The Critical Section Problem](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)

Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resources. 

4. [Difference between Deadlock and Starvation in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)

Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and wait for other resource held by any other process. Necessary conditions for deadlock to occur are Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption and Circular Wait.

Starvation is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time.

5. [DEFINITION race condition](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/race-condition#:~:text=A%20race%20condition%20is%20an,sequence%20to%20be%20done%20correctly.)

A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.
