# WEEK-00

1. [Operating system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that controls how computer hardware 
and software resources are used and offers basic services to other software applications.

2. [Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch1.pptx)<br>
This slide is a good introduction for understanding OS. With this slide I learn 
more about the OS and its environment as well as the hardware

3. [What defines an Operating System?](https://rahmatm.samik-ibrahim.vlsm.org/2021/07/what-defines-operating-system.html)<br>
The operating system is a layer of software that comes preinstalled on computers 
and is responsible for giving user programs a better, simpler, cleaner model of 
the computer and for handling all the resources already described.

4. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
By the beginning of the 1950s, computers had become so quick that manually loading 
programs using punch cards was frequently quicker than actually running them. 


# WEEK-01

1. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU)<br>
There are several Linux commands that are recommended for students to understand. 

2. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The most well-known and traditional text editor for Linux is the VI editor. The 
full-screen UNIX vi editor has two modes of operation: Insert mode, which inserts 
entered text into the file, and Command mode, which executes commands that cause 
action to be taken on the file.

3. [Regular Expressions - Linux Tutorial 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpyCeSvGh-M)<br>
Some of the commonly used commands with Regular expressions are tr, sed, vi and grep. 
Listed below are some of the basic Regex.
Symbol	Descriptions
```
.	| replaces any character
^	| matches start of string
$	| matches end of string
*	| matches up zero or more times the preceding character
\	| Represent special characters
()	| Groups regular expressions
?	| Matches up exactly one character
```

# WEEK-02

1. [what is cybersecurity ?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity)<br>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.

2. [Which Information Should You Keep Private ? ](http://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/complete-beginners-guide-to-internet-safety-privacy/)<br>
Metadata
Metadata is the descriptive information about our communications and activities. It allows for government agencies and other organizations to make inferences about you without actually listening to your phone calls or monitoring your computer. Because many of the privacy laws that the NSA and internet companies fall under are outdated, their application to metadata is unclear. This information can be used to determine someone’s location via their devices without directly “tracking” them.

Passwords
Keeping your passwords private is an obvious addition to this list. However, using strong passwords is just as important as keeping your passwords private and secure. If you are using a short and predictable password, it will be vulnerable to brute force attacks. It’s a good idea to use longer and more complex passwords, with a reputable password manager to store them. This way you can use a different password for each service without having to remember them all.

Financial Information
Keeping your financial information safe on the internet can be overwhelming, especially if you are accustomed to doing a lot of online shopping. It is important that you only share this information on secure websites that you trust and that use HTTPS (SSL encryption). Breaches in financial information can lead to identity theft and can damage your credit

3. [6 Benefits of Cyber Security – Defending Against Cyber Attacks](https://deandorton.com/cyber-security-benefits/)<br>

```
1. Protection against external threats
2. Protection against internal threats
3. Regulation compliance
4. Improved productivity
5. Cost savings and value
6. Brand trust and reputation
```

2.[File Systems in Operating System: Structure, Attributes, Types](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)

A file is a collection of correlated information which is recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage like magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes. It is a method of data collection that is used as a medium for giving input and receiving output from that program.

3.[Fragmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/fragmentation-in-operating-system)

Fragmentation is an unwanted problem in the operating system in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented. Processes can't be assigned to memory blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused. It is also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted from memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. These small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, resulting in inefficient memory use.
